Hi Ronnie!

Thanks for taking the time to check this tech test that I decided to convert into Angular.

In order to run this application, (assuming you're comfortable with GIT) simply clone the repo, run `npm i` to install dependancies via command line, and then finally fire up the development server as detailed below.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

Should you get stuck with this for whatever reason, I can happily get it up and running during the interview if required, or am contactable via jamiebohanna.webdev@gmail.com.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
